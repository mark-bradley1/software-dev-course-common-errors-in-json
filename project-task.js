üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// üß≠ Instructions:
// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary
*/


// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

// Removed the variable
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15", // Added comma
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      "name": "Alice Johnson", // Added quotes to name
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "age": null, // changed undefined to null
      "email": "bob.smith@example"
    }
  ],
  "roomDetails": {
    "type": "Suite",
    "pricePerNight": 200,
    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking"] // Removed comma after parking
  }
} // removed the back tics and the semicolon

// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I used the information I learned in the lesson to determine what the syntax errors were. I also used VS Code to help spot errors.
I also copied the code into a JSON file in VS Code to make it easier to spot errors. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
I used jsonlint to verify the code was valid
3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
The commas were the hardest to spot. They are sometimes in spots that may make since normally but not in JSON
4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
   Syntax highlighting is very helpful to me.
